Raindrop to Obsidian
This is a little python script that helps me writing a weekly review blogpost of what happened the last week. 
Over the week I collect blogposts in Raindrop.IO, this script grabs all the saved blogposts from one specified collection 
and exports it to a markdown file, sorted by tags, in my Obsidian vault. 
This script is only tested on a MAC!
